# Elo-Scores-Comparision---Streamlit-UI

Image Pair Comparison and ELO Update: Displays two images side-by-side for user selection; updates ELO scores based on user preferences.
CSV Logging: Saves each comparison result, including checkpoint, image name, and serial number, to a CSV file for record-keeping.
Category Filtering and Display: Allows users to filter and view ELO scores based on selected categories like "Broken" or "Scratches." or “PPO”
Session State and Progress Tracking: Uses Streamlite session state to track user progress, manage image pair indices, and avoid duplicate comparisons.
You can run it by using streamlit run file_name.py
